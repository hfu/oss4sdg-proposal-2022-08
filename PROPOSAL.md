## The Challenge
>Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, learners from all over the world have been forced to study from home. Many of these learners in developing countries had to abandon their studies due to a lack of appropriate digital learning infrastructure. Even those with access to stable infrastructure may face challenges to access Learning Management Systems (LMS) platforms.

>Within this framework, the Moodle mobile app and existing video conferencing plugins have been playing key roles in expanding the footprint of digital learning possibilities. However, there are still some challenges and areas for improvement, so we are looking for proactive ideas and solutions in these areas to help improve performance, expand video conferencing functionality, and consequently reach more students. We therefore propose the following challenges:

### Last minute open challenge!
>In order to expand the scope of the hackathon, we are thrilled to announce that we created a new open challenge for anyone who is working on a plugin not necessarily related to mobile of video-conferencing. Are you working on a cool plugin that can improve Moodle functionalities? Go for it and submit your proposal!

### The Mobile Challenge
>Improve or extend existing Moodle plugins (or create your own) for the Moodle mobile app, so that users can access all Moodle functionalities via mobile devices.
 
### The VideoConf Challenge
>Improve or extend existing Moodle plugins for video conferencing so that users can further easily switch to virtual classes with little effort.
